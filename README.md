# CodeClauseInternship_Facial-Emotions-Detection
This repository demonstrates a complete pipeline for facial emotion detection using deep learning. It walks through data preparation, model training, and evaluation using a labeled dataset of facial expressions.

## Features

- Downloads and unzips a pre-organized dataset of facial images categorized by emotion.
- Trains a deep learning model to classify emotions from facial images.
- Supports multiple emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.).
- Designed for use in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment with GPU acceleration.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   The notebook downloads a zipped dataset from Dropbox and extracts it. The dataset is organized into folders by emotion labels.

2. **Model Training**  
   The notebook typically includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model definition (often using CNN architectures), training, and validation steps.

3. **Emotion Detection**  
   After training, the model can predict the emotion category for new facial images.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- GPU acceleration recommended
- Common Python libraries:
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch
  - Keras (if using TensorFlow)
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
